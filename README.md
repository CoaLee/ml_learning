# Machine Learning Practice Project

## Overview
- **one cycle**: Learning &rarr; Examine &rarr; Result
- basically, use pre-created libraries or modules to see the result. 
- at first, it's more like a test or a witness of Neural Network.
- then, improve its functionalities.

## Plan for improvements & Todo
1. Learning
    - [ ] **ONE CYCLE**: use pre-created libraries
    - [ ] comparison: adjustment of data set sizes
    - [ ] comparison: another Neural Network model. such as GAN
    - [ ] self implementation of Neural Network based on some articles

2. Examination
    - [ ] **ONE CYCLE**: use small test set 
    - [ ] static img drawn by user
    - [ ] images drawn dynamically by user 

3. Result
    - [ ] **ONE CYCLE**: just output in text format
    - [ ] comparison
    - [ ] dash board
    - [ ] graph
